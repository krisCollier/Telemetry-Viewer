# Telemetry-Viewer

## What?

Quick and dirty alternative to Motec's telemetry software for use with .ld files (assetto corsa). 

## Why?

Motec requires a pro license (>1000$) to add custom math channels and also doesn't present things in a non-race engineer friendly way.

## Future improvements

- Add the ld2csv package to remove the need of manual exporting stints from motec.
- Add .html and .pdf exporting functionality
